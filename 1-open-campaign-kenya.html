			<b>What is an Open Campaign?</b>
			<p>An open campaign is public protest against a person, a set of individuals, an organization, or a
			corporation with a clear goal and transparent methods. In this case Open Campaign Kenya is a
			community based initiative to require accountability of individuals seeking positions in public
			office as early as possible.
			</p>
			<b>The Problem</b>
			<p>Over the years elections in Kenya have not undergone the process of maturity as would be
			expected, politicians continue to use unconventional methods to win voter confidence. The
			candidates who vie for office should have an almost impeccable reputations and outstanding
			track record geared towards development but, this is not the case. After elections we usually vote
			in candidates who have been in office or/and have little or no contribution to the development
			agenda. This has already been identified as a problem but no feasible solutions have been pitched
			yet.</p>
			<b>The Proposed Solution</b>
			<p>Candidates should present themselves to the public and be vetted exhaustively, from their
			experience in politics, education, profession, personal life and contribution to the national
			development plan. This will create an environment that will reveal the urgency and importance
			of the election process and its goals.</p>
			<b>Why Open Campaign Kenya?</b>
			<p>Politicians should be vetted properly through practical methods which should determine their
			applicability for the vied seats, this done in respect of the electorate. An open campaign is the
			proper mechanism to achieve this goal.</p>
			<b>The How?</b>
			<p>Open Campaign Kenya will operate based on its core value, which is accountability. The
			campaign methodology that will be employed by the campaign is one that is molded through its
			formation. Consequently, this will help in setting up an example model campaign.</p>
			</br>
			<center><b><i>&#34;The critical approach to action is sufficient to capture public confidence.&#34;</i></b></center>
			</br>
			<p>Thus, the methodology will ensure sustainability of the campaign through maintenance of
			intrinsic values; this will in turn guarantee desirable outcome.</p>

			<p>Open Campaign Kenya&#39;s strategy is to gather public support and utilize the force on a
			community level to reveal information about candidates. Based on this information the candidate
			will be engaged on discussions that will weigh their competencies, a scorecard will be
			maintained for the same.</p>

			<p>In the political arena, public office requires that one campaigns; this campaign should be
			pertinent in determining viability for office. Key aspects of managing a campaign include
			administrative and financial management, leadership and directional proficiency, communication
			and articulation skills, such skills should be tested in a public domain or forum for the electorate
			to judge, this would preferably be through series of debates.</p>

			<p>Important for the campaign should be the agendas that are sought after by the electorate. These
			agendas should constitute in the campaign curriculum the efforts and resources of the candidate.
			Examples of items on the agenda should be healthcare, internal security, minimum wage
			amongst other relevant issues.</p>

			<p>The open campaign will garner support from the public through petitions, these petitions will
			require candidates declare their track record, intentions for public office, campaign strategy,
			source of funding and any other areas that relate to their candidature. Open Campaign Kenya will
			seek to resolve the integrity of such information and the accountability of the candidates in order
			to help the public determine candidates&#39; viability for office.</p>

			<p>Tools and skilled labor will be needed to achieve these goals; hence volunteer efforts will be
			sourced openly from the public. Basic operational units of the society will consist of multi skilled
			groups in order to encourage cohesion of volunteers. Real world, short and aggressive tests will
			be held to determine innovation, efficiency, effectiveness and timeliness of group delivery. In
			order for effective interactive communication to take place within the society and in the public
			domain, it will be paramount that the project be heavily dependent on information technology i.e.
			usage of email, social media, mobile gadgets, open source web tools amongst other
			communication media.</p>

			<b>Principles of Open Campaign Kenya</b>
			<p>The only source of funding for a project of this nature is through donations openly given by
			members of the public as a campaign should be. Open campaign will not receive any financial
			assistance that will not be publicly declared. It will not endeavor to carry out any project without
			a publicly declared budget and project management plan. It will constitute of volunteers from the
			public who have no personal agendas and will not receive any personal benefits apart from
			sustenance during individual projects. It will ensure reports to donors and financial audits are
			carried out to determine proper usage of funds.</p>
