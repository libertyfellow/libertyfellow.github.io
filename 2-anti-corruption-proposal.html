			<b>Problem Statement</b>
			<p>The basic definition of corruption is the misuse of power by those in authority. In more expository terms: corruption is a cancer that saps away the strength of the public service apparatus. It weakens the endeavor to responsibly serve&#59; impedes the missions, goals and objectives of the public institutions due to its communicable nature&#59; it systematically weighs down on moral direction of an institution. Corruption is quick to infect those who come to proximity with it making them highly susceptible to its degenerative effects. Corruption works by compromising the morals and values of its target thus making the process among involved parties less efficient and less effective. Continuous practice of corruption facilitates an environment of investment into the vice that creates a culture that is rather surgical in its decadent operations. Corruptions main assault is on the integrity that acceptable conduct is meant to create and uphold.</p>

			<b>Goals</b>
			<p>In order for the strategy to be successful there must be a solid foundation that validates actions in a stepwise manner to serve as a reference point:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Process Vigilance</b></br>
					Implement a process monitoring framework that can server as a benchmark where actual events within a process can be checked for compliance.
				</li></br>
				<li>
					<b>Explicit Communication</b></br>
					Ensuring clear and systematically logged communication of responsibilities for the reference purposes.
				</li></br>
				<li>
					<b>Work Continuity</b></br>
					Ensuring an acceptable standard of work quality, transparent transmission channels, handover mechanisms and appropriate information exchange procedures among work units, all for work ownership transition purposes.
				</li></br>
			</ol>
			<b>Objectives</b>
			<p>There are three main objectives in the proposed strategy:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Instituting ethics academia to propel awareness in ethical issues.</li>
				<li>Engage public offices in ethics campaign to ensure continuity in overseeing ethical matters.</li>
				<li>Instituting anti-corruption enforcement to counter gross ethical misconduct.</li>
			</ol>
			<b>Strategy</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>I)&nbsp;Ethics Institute</b></br>
					<p>It is important to make the public aware of ethical issues that concern the work of the public service institutions. It is even more important to ensure the public service officers understand ethics related issues concerning their work. Ethical practices ensure that an individual/institution conducts itself/himself/herself in such a way that is viewed by the public as acceptable and legal behavior that is beyond reproach and far from misdeeds, this maintains public confidence in the office. It is of paramount importance that the endeavor to fight corruption is propelled by a publicly recognized academic institution which is specialized in ethics, here the public can learn and advance in issues concerning ethics and conduct. In such an institution examinations should measure retention capacity and application ability of an individual who is undertaking an ethics course &#45; case studies should be the corner stone of ethics education, and an endurance exam should be administered that gauges the level of a students understanding.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>II)&nbsp;Ethics Campaign</b></br>
					<p>
						A public ethics office should be set up to serves as a dispatch point for public ethics officers who&#39;ve undergone training in the ethics institute. This office should monitor public service institutions&#39; performance in upholding an acceptable level of ethics through the ethics officers. Public ethics officers would set up shop in public service institutions with help from their head office. The campaign should encourage an appropriate level of academic qualification in ethics for public service officers which should also be subject to review over time. If a public service officer&#39;s conduct would be found in want then the public ethics office would recommend taking or retaking the appropriate course and examination or reexamination, if the misconduct should be gross then the public officer should be reported through proper channels to the law enforcement authority. The public ethics office should encourage public institutions to voluntary setup internal ethics advisory and monitoring units. The main role of the public ethics office would generally be oversight and advisory. The public ethics office will be a data intensive institution thus it will need to leverage benefits of information technology to make sense of large datasets that are accumulated over time from review of public service officers conduct.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>III)&nbsp;Anti-Corruption Enforcement</b></br>
					<p>
					In the past the anti-corruption authorities have been set back by intimidation of officials, lack of cooperation, running officials out of office all in the aim to frustrate corruption combating efforts. If the anti-corruption authorities&#39; body would rest upon law enforcement the ills that cumber its efforts would be fended off. If the anti-corruption authorities were a unit of the police they would have access to resources that would go a long way to ensuring their success. Recruitment of officers would be from foundational areas of the police &#45; this would encourage police to keep a clean track record &#45; only officers with a good scorecard would attain candidature, academic qualifications would include certification from the ethics institution. Further training and qualifications would involve fields of audit and detective/investigative works. This would all serve to create confidence in the anti-corruption enforcement officer.
