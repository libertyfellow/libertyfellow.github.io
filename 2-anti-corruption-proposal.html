			<p><center><b>Anti-Corruption Proposal</b></center></p>
			<b>Problem Statement</b>
			<p>The basic definition of corruption is the misuse of power by those in authority. In more expository
			terms: corruption is a cancer that saps away the strength of the public service apparatus. It weakens the
			endeavor to responsibly serve&#59; impedes the missions, goals and objectives of the public institutions due
			to its communicable nature&#59; it systematically weighs down on moral direction of an institution.
			Corruption is quick to infect those who come to proximity with it making them highly susceptible to its
			degenerative effects. Corruption works by compromising the morals and values of its target thus
			making the process among involved parties less efficient and less effective. Continuous practice of
			corruption facilitates an environment of investment into the vice that creates a culture that is rather
			surgical in its decadent operations. Corruptions main assault is on the integrity that acceptable conduct
			is meant to create and uphold</p>
			<b>Goals</b>
			<p>In order for a strategy to be successful there must be a solid foundation to serve as a reference point and
			validation for each course of action taken. Goals for the strategy should be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Vigilance over process</b></br>
					Create a benchmark by which actual events within a process can be compared to in order to
					monitor for deviations.
				</li></br>
				<li>
					<b>Discretion in communication</b></br>
					Ensuring clear and proper communication of responsibilities with reliable support system for
					the purpose of reference.
				</li></br>
				<li>
					<b>Continuity of work</b></br>
					Ensuring an acceptable standard of work quality and proper transmission mechanism including
					appropriate transition/changeover procedure among units.
				</li></br>
			</ol>
			<b>Objectives</b>
			<p>There are three main objectives in the proposed strategy:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Instituting ethics academia to propel awareness in ethical issues</li>
				<li>Engage public offices in ethics campaign to ensure continuity of oversight in ethical matters</li>
				<li>Instituting anti-corruption enforcement to counter gross ethical misdeeds</li>
			</ol>
			<b>Strategy</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>I)&nbsp;Ethics Institute</b></br>
					<p>
					It is important to make the public aware of ethical issues that concern the work of the public
					service institutions. It is even more important to ensure the public service officers understand
					ethics related issues concerning their work. Ethical practices ensure that an
					individual/institution conducts itself/himself/herself in such a way that is viewed by the public
					as acceptable and legal behavior that is beyond reproach and far from misdeeds, this maintains
					public confidence in the office. It is of paramount importance that the endeavor to fight
					corruption is propelled by a publicly recognized academic institution which is specialized in
					ethics, here the public can learn and advance in issues concerning ethics and conduct. In such an
					institution examinations should measure retention capacity and application ability of an
					individual who is undertaking an ethics course &#45; an endurance exam should be administered
					that should gauge the level of understanding.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>II)&nbsp;Ethics Campaign</b></br>
					<p>
					A public ethics office should be set up to serves as a dispatch point for public ethics officers
					who&#39;ve undergone training in the ethics institute. This office should monitor public service
					institutions&#39; performance in upholding an acceptable level of ethics through the ethics officers.
					Public ethics officers would set up shop in public service institutions with help from their head
					office. The campaign should encourage an appropriate level of academic qualification in ethics
					for public service officers which should also be subject to review over time. If a public service
					officer&#39;s conduct would be found in want then the public ethics office would recommend taking
					or retaking the appropriate course and examination or reexamination, if the misconduct should
					be gross then the public officer should be reported through proper channels to the law
					enforcement authority. The public ethics office should encourage public institutions to voluntary
					setup internal ethics advisory and monitoring units. The main role of the public ethics office
					would generally be oversight and advisory. The public ethics office will be a data intensive
					institution thus it will need to leverage information technology to make sense of large datasets
					that are accumulated over time from review of public service officers conduct.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>III)&nbsp;Instituting Anti-Corruption Enforcement</b></br>
					<p>
						In the past the anti-corruption authorities have been set back by intimidation of officials, lack of
						cooperation, running officials out of office all in the aim to frustrate corruption combating
						efforts. If the anti-corruption authorities&#39; body would rest upon law enforcement the ills that
						cumber its efforts would be fended off. If the anti-corruption authorities were a unit of the
						police they would have access to resources that would go a long way to ensuring their success.
						Recruitment of officers would be from foundational areas of the police &#45; this would encourage
						police to keep a clean track record &#45; only officers with a good scorecard would attain
						candidature, academic qualifications would include certification from the ethics institution.
						Further training and qualifications would involve fields of audit and detective/investigative
						works. This would all serve to create confidence in the anti-corruption enforcement officer
